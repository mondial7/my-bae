# My Bae
Something about my dev stack

... :construction: ...

install: clone... npm install...

## Developing

```
npm run forest
```
(... gonna watch you 🧐)

## Testing 

```
npm test
```
(surprise surprise 🤓)

## Wrapping up

```
npm run build
```
(or just do nothing if Forest was running - after all... Run, Forest, run!)
